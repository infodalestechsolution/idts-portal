						<h2>AEM ARCHITECTURE</h2>

						<h3 style="text-align: left;   margin: 0%;">Architecture Stack:</h3>
						<p>Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) architecture is built on a modular and scalable stack that supports creating, managing, and delivering digital experiences. Here's an overview of the key components in the AEM architecture stack:</p>
						<div class="image-container">
							<img src="/images/AEM-Intro/AEM_Architecture.webp" alt="AEM Archutecture">
						</div>
						<ol style="margin-left: auto; width: 93%;">
							 <li><p><strong>Java Platform:</strong> The Java platform plays a pivotal role, serving as the backbone for the entire system. AEM is built on a Java-based architecture, leveraging the strengths of the Java programming language to deliver a scalable, robust, and extensible platform for managing digital experiences.</p></li>
							 <li><p><strong>Java Runtime Environment (JRE):</strong> JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. The Java Runtime Environment is a package of software that provides the minimum requirements for executing Java applications. It includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), libraries, and other components needed to run Java programs.</p></li>
							 <li><p><strong>Granite Platform:</strong> Granite is Adobeâ€™s Open Web Stack. The Granite Platform is an underlying foundation and set of core services in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). It provides a framework for building and running AEM applications, facilitating common functionalities and services that are essential for content management, user interface, and system operations.</p></li>
							 <li><p><strong>Servlet engine:</strong> typically refers to the underlying technology that handles the execution of Java servlets within the AEM application. A servlet engine, also known as a servlet container or servlet runner, is responsible for managing the lifecycle of servlets, processing client requests, and generating dynamic content. In the context of AEM, which is built on a Java-based architecture, the servlet engine plays a crucial role in handling HTTP requests and managing the communication between the web server and the AEM application. AEM uses the Apache Sling framework, which is essentially a servlet engine, to process and respond to requests.</p></li>
							 <li><p><strong>CRXDE:</strong> refers to the Content Repository Extreme, the underlying repository technology used in AEM. The "de" in "CRX de" specifically stands for "Day Edition," as the technology was originally developed by Day Software, the company that created the predecessor of AEM. CRX is a Java Content Repository (JCR) that serves as the foundation for storing, managing, and retrieving digital assets, content, and configurations within AEM. It provides a hierarchical and standardized way to organize and access content, and it follows the specifications outlined in the Java Content Repository API (JSR-170 and JSR-283).</p></li>
							 <li><p><strong>Sling Content Delivery:</strong> the Apache Sling framework processes and delivers dynamic by interpreting resource-based URLs and invoking the appropriate scripts or servlets to generate the content for end-users.</p></li>
						</ol>
						<h2>OSGi Framework:</h2> 
						<p>The OSGi (Open Services Gateway Initiative) framework is a fundamental component of the Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) architecture. OSGi is a modular and dynamic framework for Java that enables the development of modular applications by providing a standardized way to manage and deploy components.</p>
						<div class="image-container">
							<img src="/images/AEM-Intro/Aem_framework.webp" alt="AEM Archutecture">
						</div>
						
						<h4><strong>Java Content Repository (JCR):</strong></h4><p>The AEM JCR (Java Content Repository) stands as a cornerstone, weaving together the fabric of content management with its unique blend of hierarchical organization and standardized access. The Java Content Repository API articulates an abstract model and a Java API tailored for data storage and services intricately entwined with content-centric applications.</p>
						<ol style="margin-left: auto; width: 93%;">
							 <li><p>Hierarchical Data Model: JCR represents content as a tree-like structure where each node can have child nodes. This hierarchical data model is well-suited for organizing content in a way that reflects the relationships between different pieces of information.</p></li>
							 <li><p>Node Types: JCR defines node types that specify the characteristics and properties of nodes. Nodes can be of different types, each with its own set of properties and behaviors. For example, AEM uses predefined node types for pages, components, and assets.</p></li>
							 <li><p>Content Versioning: JCR supports versioning of content, allowing for the tracking and management of different versions of a node. This is particularly important in a content management system like AEM, where content changes over time.</p></li>
							 <li><p>Query Language (JCR-SQL2 and XPath): JCR provides query languages like JCR-SQL2 and XPath, enabling users to search and retrieve content based on specific criteria. This is essential for content authors and developers when accessing and manipulating content within AEM.</p></li>
							 <li><p>Access Control: JCR includes mechanisms for access control, allowing administrators to define and manage permissions on nodes. This ensures that only authorized users have the necessary privileges to read or modify specific content.</p></li>
						</ol>
						<h4><strong>Apache Sling:</strong> </h4><p>Apache Sling is a key framework that plays a fundamental role in handling the web request-response cycle and facilitating content-centric applications.</p>
						
						<ol style="margin-left: auto; width: 93%;">
							 <li><p><strong>Dynamic Content Choreography: </strong> Apache Sling, akin to a seasoned conductor, choreographs the dynamic rendering of content. It doesn't just respond to requests; it interprets them, dynamically selecting the right content resource based on URLs. This dynamic choreography ensures a personalized and engaging experience for users.</p></li>
							 <li><p><strong>RESTful Rhythm: </strong> Apache Sling, being a framework designed for RESTful content-centric applications in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), follows RESTful principles to facilitate efficient communication and data exchange. Representation of Resources, Resource Identification through URI, Resource Manipulation through Representations, Stateless Communication, Uniform Interface</p></li>
							 <li><p><strong>Scripting Serenade: </strong> Picture a script as the musical score of this dance. Apache Sling serenades with scripting languages like Sightly (HTL), providing a templating engine for developers and content authors. This scripting symphony enables the creation of adaptive templates, where creativity and functionality elegantly intertwine.</p></li>
							 <li><p><strong>OSGi Overture: </strong> As the ballet unfolds, Apache Sling seamlessly integrates with the OSGi (Open Services Gateway Initiative) frameworkâ€”a foundational overture in AEM's modular architecture. This integration enables the creation of modular applications, where components elegantly dance together in a synchronized performance.</p></li>
						</ol>

						<h2>TYPES OF AEM </h2>
						<img style=" width: 70%;    padding-left: 10%;" src="/images/AEM-Intro/AEM-Type.webp" alt="AEM Archutecture">
						<h2>On-Premise:</h2>
						<p>On-premise (standalone) deployment in AEM refers to the installation and hosting of the AEM software on servers that are physically located within an organization's own infrastructure or data center.</p>
						<ol>
							 <li><p><strong>Local Infrastructure:</strong> In this deployment model, organizations acquire and maintain their servers, networking equipment, and other necessary hardware components. AEM is installed and configured directly on these servers, forming a dedicated environment within the organization's premises.</p></li>
							 <li><p><strong>Control and Customization:</strong> On-premise deployment provides organizations with complete control over the AEM infrastructure. This includes customizing server configurations, network settings, and security measures according to the organization's specific needs and compliance requirements.</p></li>
							 <li><p><strong>Security and Compliance:</strong> Organizations can implement tailored security measures and compliance protocols, ensuring that AEM aligns with the organization's internal policies and industry standards. This level of control is particularly important for industries with strict regulatory requirements.</p></li>
							 <li><p><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Organizations are responsible for managing and maintaining the entire AEM infrastructure, including hardware, software updates, security patches, and backups. While this grants control, it also requires dedicated IT resources and expertise to ensure optimal performance and security.</p></li>
						</ol>
						<h2>Cloud as a Service:</h2>
						<p>"AEM Cloud as a Service" refers to the deployment model of AEM where the AEM environment is hosted and managed in the cloud by Adobe or a cloud service provider. In this model, organizations do not need to set up and maintain their infrastructure instead, they leverage cloud-based resources for hosting and accessing AEM.</p>
						<ol style="margin-left: auto; width: 93%;">
							 <li><p><strong>Cloud Hosting:</strong> The Cloud as a Service option involves Adobe hosting and managing the AEM environment on cloud infrastructure such as Adobe's Managed Services or other cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Adobe takes care of the underlying infrastructure, including servers, storage, and networking.</p></li>
							 <li><p><strong>Scalability and Flexibility:</strong> Cloud as a Service provides scalability, allowing organizations to scale resources up or down based on demand easily. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for handling varying workloads, ensuring optimal performance during peak times without the need for upfront investments in hardware.</p></li>
							 <li><p><strong>Managed Services:</strong> Adobe or a chosen cloud service provider manages routine tasks such as software updates, security patches, and infrastructure maintenance. This offloads operational responsibilities from the organization, allowing them to focus more on utilizing AEM for content management and digital experience optimization.</p></li>
							 <li><p><strong>Rapid Deployment:</strong> Cloud-based deployments offer rapid deployment, reducing the time and effort required to set up and configure the AEM environment.
